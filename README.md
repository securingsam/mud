# mud_files
MUD is a specification designed to protect IoT devices against network attacks. It allows a device to specify the network access required for proper functionality, so that any other access can be blocked. You can find more information [here](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/mud/#!what-is-mud/what-is-mud).

This repository contains MUD files that we generated for selected IoT devices:
* Wemo Mini 2
* Hikvision DS-2CD2120F-I cameras
* Nest Protect
* Kasa HS100
